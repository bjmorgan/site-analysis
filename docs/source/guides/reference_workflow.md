# The Reference-Based Sites Workflow

## Introduction

The Reference-Based Sites workflow provides a method for defining crystallographic sites based on coordination environments rather than fixed spatial coordinates. This approach defines sites according to their chemical context within the structure, which persists even as the structure undergoes distortions during molecular dynamics simulations.

Rather than defining sites at absolute coordinates, this method identifies sites by their coordination environment (e.g., a site where a lithium ion is coordinated by four oxygen atoms). This definition remains meaningful even when atomic positions fluctuate due to thermal motion or structural relaxation.

The primary advantage of this workflow is its efficiency: it automates the creation of polyhedral and dynamic Voronoi sites, eliminating the need to define these sites manually. This simplifies what would otherwise be a laborious process of identifying and specifying site geometries.

## Basic Implementation

The most common way to use the Reference-Based Sites workflow is through the `TrajectoryBuilder` class, which provides a convenient interface to the underlying functionality:

```python
from site_analysis import TrajectoryBuilder
from pymatgen.core import Structure

# Load structures
ideal_structure = Structure.from_file("ideal_structure.cif")
target_structure = Structure.from_file("md_frame.vasp")

# Create a trajectory with tetrahedral Li sites
# This uses the RBS workflow internally through the TrajectoryBuilder
trajectory = (TrajectoryBuilder()
    .with_structure(target_structure)
    .with_reference_structure(reference_structure)
    .with_mobile_species("Li")
    .with_polyhedral_sites(
        centre_species="Li",
        vertex_species="O",
        cutoff=2.5,
        n_vertices=4,
        label="tetrahedral"
    )
    .build())
```

This implementation:
1. Uses an ideal reference structure to define tetrahedral coordination environments
2. Creates corresponding sites in the target structure 
3. Automatically aligns the reference structure to the target structure, ensuring the coordination environments can be correctly mapped between them

The TrajectoryBuilder's `.with_polyhedral_sites()` and `.with_dynamic_voronoi_sites()` methods both utilize the RBS workflow internally, providing a streamlined interface for this functionality.

## Workflow Mechanism

The Reference-Based Sites workflow operates through these steps:

1. Structure alignment between reference and target
2. Identification of specified coordination environments in the reference structure
3. Mapping of these environments from reference to target structure
4. Creation of appropriate site objects in the target structure

## Structure Requirements

For the Reference-Based Sites workflow to function correctly, the reference and target structures must satisfy these essential requirements:

1. **Matching atom counts for alignment species**: 
   
   The atomic species used for alignment must have identical counts in both the reference and target structures. This requirement can be satisfied through either full structure alignment (when reference and target have identical stoichiometry) or subset alignment (when they differ).
   
   Subset alignment allows sites defined in a stoichiometric reference structure to be mapped onto an off-stoichiometric target structure (containing vacancies or interstitials) by aligning solely on the framework atoms that are present in equal numbers in both structures.

2. **Same supercell dimensions**: 
   
   Both structures must use consistent supercell conventions to ensure proper mapping between them. The absolute size of both structures must match to maintain the spatial relationship between coordination environments.

3. **Same orientation**: 
   
   The structures must have identical orientations as the alignment process only handles translation, not rotation. Lattice vectors must be oriented consistently between the reference and target structures to ensure proper superposition.

## Configuration Options

### Structure Alignment

When working with reference and target structures that have different numbers of mobile atoms (such as when analyzing vacancies, interstitials, or defective structures), alignment can be performed using a subset of atomic species.

**Important**: Structure alignment is **enabled by default** for the reference-based workflow, even if not explicitly configured. To disable alignment, you must explicitly set `align=False`.

```python
trajectory = (TrajectoryBuilder()
    .with_structure(target_structure)
    .with_reference_structure(reference_structure)
    .with_mobile_species("Li")
    .with_structure_alignment(
        align=True,                  # Enable alignment (default)
        align_species=["O", "Ti"],   # Framework atoms only
        align_metric='rmsd',         # Optimise root-mean-square distance (default)
        align_algorithm='Nelder-Mead',  # Default local optimizer
        align_tolerance=1e-4         # Default alignment precision
    )
    .with_polyhedral_sites(
        centre_species="Li",
        vertex_species="O",
        cutoff=2.5,
        n_vertices=4
    )
    .build())
```

This example shows how to specify framework atoms for alignment by using the `align_species` parameter. By selecting only framework species that have consistent counts in both structures, proper alignment can be achieved even when the mobile ion content differs between reference and target structures.

#### Alignment Parameters

All alignment parameters are optional and have sensible defaults:

- **Enable/Disable**: The `align` parameter (default: `True`) controls whether structure alignment is performed at all. Setting `align=False` disables alignment, which may be appropriate when structures are already perfectly aligned or when testing alternative workflows.

- **Species Selection**: The `align_species` parameter specifies which atomic species are used for alignment. This should be species that have consistent counts in both reference and target structures:
  - If `None` (default), mapping species will be used if specified, otherwise all common species
  - Can be a single species string (e.g., `"O"`) or a list of species (e.g., `["O", "Ti"]`)
  - Typically framework atoms are used to avoid issues with different mobile ion counts

- **Alignment Metric**: The `align_metric` parameter (default: `'rmsd'`) determines what distance measurement is minimised:
  - `'rmsd'`: Root-mean-square deviation - minimises the average distance between corresponding atoms across both structures
  - `'max_dist'`: Maximum distance - minimises the maximum distance between any corresponding atom pair (focuses on the largest misalignment)

- **Tolerance**: The `align_tolerance` parameter (default: `1e-4`) controls the convergence criteria for the alignment optimization algorithm. A smaller value (e.g., 1e-5) requires more precise alignment, while a larger value (e.g., 1e-3) allows quicker convergence with potentially less precise alignment.

- **Optimization Algorithm**: The `align_algorithm` parameter (default: `'Nelder-Mead'`) determines which numerical optimization approach is used:
  - `'Nelder-Mead'`: A local optimization method that works well when structures are already roughly aligned or have similar origins. It's faster but may get stuck in local minima.
  - `'differential_evolution'`: A global optimization method that's more robust when structures have very different origins or orientations. It's slower but better at finding the optimal alignment when local methods fail.

- **Minimizer Options**: For fine-grained control, `align_minimizer_options` accepts a dictionary of algorithm-specific parameters:
  ```python
  # For differential_evolution
  align_minimizer_options={
      'popsize': 20,      # Population size (default: 15)
      'maxiter': 1000,    # Maximum iterations (default: 1000)
      'strategy': 'best1bin'  # Mutation strategy
  }
  
  # For Nelder-Mead
  align_minimizer_options={
      'maxiter': 2000,    # Maximum iterations
      'xatol': 1e-4,      # Absolute tolerance on parameters
      'fatol': 1e-4       # Absolute tolerance on function value
  }
  ```

#### When to Use Global Optimization

Consider using `align_algorithm='differential_evolution'` when:
- Structures have very different origins (not just small displacements)
- Nelder-Mead consistently fails to find a good alignment
- You see error messages about optimization failure or reaching maximum iterations
- You're working with complex structures where the alignment landscape might have multiple local minima

Example with global optimization:
```python
trajectory = (TrajectoryBuilder()
    .with_structure(target_structure)
    .with_reference_structure(reference_structure)
    .with_mobile_species("Li")
    .with_structure_alignment(
        align_species=["O", "Ti"],
        align_algorithm='differential_evolution',  # Global optimizer
        align_metric='max_dist',                   # Minimize worst-case alignment
        align_minimizer_options={'popsize': 20}    # Larger population 
    )
    .with_polyhedral_sites(...)
    .build())
```

### Site Mapping Configuration

The site mapping process identifies which atoms define site geometry:

```python
trajectory = (TrajectoryBuilder()
    .with_structure(target_structure)
    .with_reference_structure(reference_structure)
    .with_mobile_species("Li")
    .with_structure_alignment(align_species=["O", "Ti"])
    .with_site_mapping(mapping_species=["O"])  # Use oxygen atoms for site definition
    .with_polyhedral_sites(
        centre_species="Li",
        vertex_species="O",
        cutoff=2.5,
        n_vertices=4
    )
    .build())
```

The `mapping_species` parameter controls which atoms are used to define site geometries. For polyhedral sites, these atoms form the vertices of the polyhedra, while for dynamic Voronoi sites, they serve as reference atoms for calculating site centers.

### Periodic Boundary Condition Handling

The Reference-Based Sites workflow provides control over how periodic boundary conditions are handled when creating polyhedral and dynamic Voronoi sites. **Reference centre unwrapping is enabled by default** and is the recommended approach for all use cases.

```python
trajectory = (TrajectoryBuilder()
    .with_structure(target_structure)
    .with_reference_structure(reference_structure)
    .with_mobile_species("Li")
    .with_polyhedral_sites(
        centre_species="Li",
        vertex_species="O",
        cutoff=2.5,
        n_vertices=4,
        use_reference_centers=True  # Default: reference centre unwrapping
    )
    .build())

# Alternative: spread-based detection (advanced usage only)
trajectory = (TrajectoryBuilder()
    .with_structure(target_structure)
    .with_reference_structure(reference_structure)
    .with_mobile_species("Li")
    .with_polyhedral_sites(
        centre_species="Li",
        vertex_species="O",
        cutoff=2.5,
        n_vertices=4,
        use_reference_centers=False  # Use spread-based method
    )
    .build())
```

#### PBC Handling Methods

The `use_reference_centers` parameter controls which of two methods is used:

- **Reference centre unwrapping** (`use_reference_centers=True`, default): Uses each site's central atom position as an anchor point for unwrapping vertex coordinates to their closest periodic images. This method works correctly even in small supercells where sites may legitimately span more than 50% of unit cell dimensions.

- **Spread-based detection** (`use_reference_centers=False`): Identifies wrapped sites based on the spatial distribution of reference atoms. This method should only be used when you are confident that all sites have spans well below 0.5 times the simulation cell dimensions in all directions, and is inappropriate for relatively small simulation cells.

#### When to Use Each Method

**Default choice (recommended)**: Use reference centre unwrapping for all analyses. This method handles small supercells correctly and is robust across different system types.

**Advanced usage only**: The spread-based method may provide modest performance improvements in some large systems, but should only be used when you have verified that all coordination environments remain well below half the simulation cell dimensions throughout your analysis.

For detailed explanations of both methods, their trade-offs, and guidance on when to use each approach, see {doc}`../concepts/pbc_handling`.

## Best Practices

For optimal results:

1. **Use crystallographically defined reference structures**
   
   Use structures with well-defined, regular coordination environments as references. Geometry-optimized structures often provide clearer coordination patterns and more consistent site definitions. Ensure the reference contains examples of all relevant site types you wish to analyze in your target structures.

2. **Select appropriate alignment species**
   
   Use immobile framework atoms for alignment to ensure reliable mapping between structures. Framework atoms typically maintain more consistent positions compared to mobile species being studied.

3. **Adjust cutoff parameters as needed**
   
   Optimize cutoff values based on typical bond distances in your system. Different materials may require different cutoff values to properly identify coordination environments, so some experimentation with these parameters may be necessary.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

### No Sites Found

```
ValueError: No polyhedral sites found for centre_species='Li', vertex_species='O'...
```

This error occurs when the specified coordination environments cannot be found in the reference structure. Adjust the `cutoff` value incrementally to capture the appropriate coordination shells. Verify that the specified species exist in the reference structure, and confirm that `n_vertices` corresponds to the actual coordination environment.

### Alignment Errors

```
ValueError: Different number of O atoms: 24 in reference vs 20 in target
```

This error indicates a mismatch in atom counts between structures. Verify that both structures use consistent supercell dimensions and that alignment species have identical counts in both structures. For structures with different compositions, use only framework atoms with consistent counts for alignment.

### Mapping Conflicts

```
ValueError: 1:1 mapping violation: Multiple reference atoms map to the same target atom(s)
```

This error occurs when the mapping cannot establish a one-to-one correspondence between reference and target atoms. Verify that structures have consistent orientations, as alignment only handles translation. Try alternative mapping species if the current selection causes ambiguities. Check for unusually distorted coordination environments that might prevent clean mapping.

## Advanced Implementation

For specialized applications requiring more direct control, the RBS workflow can be accessed directly:

```python
from site_analysis.reference_workflow import ReferenceBasedSites

# Initialize the reference-based workflow
rbs = ReferenceBasedSites(
    reference_structure=reference_structure,
    target_structure=target_structure,
    align=True,
    align_species=["O"]
)

# Create polyhedral sites
polyhedral_sites = rbs.create_polyhedral_sites(
    center_species="Li",
    vertex_species="O",
    cutoff=2.5,
    n_vertices=4,
    label="tetrahedral"
)

# These sites can then be used with custom analysis workflows
from site_analysis import Trajectory, atoms_from_structure
atoms = atoms_from_structure(target_structure, "Li")
trajectory = Trajectory(sites=polyhedral_sites, atoms=atoms)
```

This direct approach provides additional control for specialized analyses and can be integrated with custom analysis workflows.
