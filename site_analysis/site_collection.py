"""Abstract base class for collections of sites in crystal structures.

This module defines the SiteCollection abstraction, which manages groups of
related Site objects and provides methods for assigning atoms to these sites
based on their positions in a crystal structure.

The SiteCollection class serves as an abstract base class that all specific
site collection types (PolyhedralSiteCollection, SphericalSiteCollection, etc.)
must inherit from. It defines the interface for site-atom assignment logic
and provides common functionality for managing site occupations.

Concrete site collection classes must implement methods to:
- Assign atoms to sites for a given structure
- Analyze structure and update site assignments
- Define structure-specific site relationships like neighboring sites

This class should not be instantiated directly; use one of the concrete
subclasses instead.
