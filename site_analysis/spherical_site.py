"""Spherical site representation for crystal structure analysis.

This module provides the SphericalSite class, which represents a site defined
by a sphere with a specific center position and radius. Spherical sites are the
simplest site geometry, useful for quick analysis or when the exact shape of
the site is less important than its location.

SphericalSite determines whether atoms are inside the site volume by checking
if the distance between the atom and the site center is less than or equal to
the site's radius. This calculation considers periodic boundary conditions using
the structure's lattice.

Unlike polyhedral sites, spherical sites have a fixed geometry independent of
atom positions in the structure, making them suitable for applications where
consistent site volumes are needed regardless of structural distortions.

Note:
    SphericalSite objects are typically used with SphericalSiteCollection,
    which implements specific assignment logic for handling atoms in overlapping
    sites.
